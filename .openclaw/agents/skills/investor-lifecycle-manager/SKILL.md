### Optional

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brand_guidelines` | object | auto-loaded | Brand config from ~/.cre-skills/brand-guidelines.json (auto-loaded, user can override) |

## Process

### Step 0: Load Brand Guidelines (Auto)

Before generating any deliverable:
1. Check if `~/.cre-skills/brand-guidelines.json` exists
2. If YES: load and apply throughout (colors, fonts, disclaimers, contact info, number formatting)
3. If NO: ask the user:
   > "I don't have your brand guidelines saved yet. Would you like to set them up now with `/cre-skills:brand-config`? Or I can proceed with professional defaults."
   - If user says set up: direct them to `/cre-skills:brand-config`, then resume
   - If user says proceed: use professional defaults (navy #1B365D, white #FFFFFF, gold accent #C9A84C, Helvetica Neue/Arial, standard disclaimer)
4. Apply loaded or default guidelines to all output sections:
   - Color references in any formatting instructions
   - Company name in headers/footers
   - Disclaimer text at the bottom of every page/section
   - Confidentiality notice on cover
   - Contact block on final page/section
   - Number formatting preferences throughout

### Step 1: Investor Meeting Preparation

1. Identify meeting type: quarterly update, annual review, ad hoc, prospect
2. Pull portfolio performance summary: gross/net returns, by-property attribution
3. Generate talking points based on portfolio condition:
   - **Outperforming**: Lead with alpha generation, attribution to strategy, risk-adjusted metrics
   - **Underperforming**: Lead with market context, remediation plan, forward outlook
   - **Mixed**: Segment by performing/challenged, show dispersion management
4. Prepare Q&A anticipation matrix (see reference: investor-meeting-framework.md)
5. Build follow-up workflow: 24-hour thank-you, 1-week action items, 30-day check-in

### Step 2: Benchmark Comparison & Performance Attribution

1. Select appropriate benchmark (NPI for unleveraged, ODCE for open-end diversified)
2. Decompose total return: income return + appreciation return + leverage effect
3. Calculate time-weighted and money-weighted (IRR) returns
4. Construct peer universe: same strategy, same vintage +/- 1 year
5. Compute alpha: fund TWR minus benchmark TWR, adjusted for leverage differential
6. Vintage year analysis: compare capital deployment pace and J-curve position
7. Present quartile ranking within peer universe
8. Reference: benchmark-methodology.md for full decomposition methodology

### Step 3: Fund Cash Management

1. Model capital call schedule: remaining unfunded commitments, deployment pipeline
2. Project distribution timeline: scheduled refinancings, dispositions, operating cash flow
3. Calculate fund-level liquidity: cash on hand, credit facility availability, near-term calls
4. Monitor recycling provisions: reinvestment period status, recycled capital tracking
5. Prepare capital call/distribution notice with 10-business-day advance notice
6. Track investor-level commitment status: called %, uncalled, excuse/exclude elections

### Step 4: Audit Coordination

1. Engage auditor (typically 90 days before fiscal year-end for planning)
2. Prepare PBC list (40+ items, see reference: audit-coordination-checklist.yaml)
3. Organize documents by category: financials, capital accounts, fees, valuations, legal, tax
4. Coordinate valuation timing: ensure Q4 appraisals complete before audit fieldwork
5. Track document requests with status and owner assignments
6. Manage auditor inquiries and management representation letter
7. Review draft financial statements and footnotes
8. Target: signed opinion within 90 days of fiscal year-end (March 31 for Dec FYE)

### Step 5: Re-Up Solicitation

1. Assess re-up eligibility: existing LPs in good standing, commitment history
2. Prepare fund-specific track record: gross/net IRR, equity multiple, DPI, TVPI
3. Build case study package: 3-5 representative deals showing value creation
4. Model next fund terms comparison: management fee, carry, preferred return, catch-up
5. Draft side letter inventory: identify MFN-triggering provisions
6. Create LP-specific re-up memo: relationship history, prior commitments, contact log
7. Timeline: begin 12-18 months before target final close

### Step 6: GIPS Composite Update

1. Verify composite definition: strategy, vintage, vehicle type inclusion rules
2. Confirm all eligible portfolios included (no cherry-picking)
3. Calculate composite returns: asset-weighted using beginning-of-period values
4. Compute dispersion: high, low, standard deviation of individual portfolio returns
5. Update composite presentation: minimum 5 years (or since inception if shorter)
6. Verify required disclosures: firm definition, composite description, benchmark, fee schedule
7. Annual verification by independent third party
8. Maintain compliant presentation format per GIPS 2020 standards

### Step 7: Investor Satisfaction Tracking

1. Design satisfaction survey: 5 categories (reporting quality, responsiveness, transparency, performance communication, operational efficiency)
2. Administer annually (Q1, covering prior year) or after major events
3. Track Net Promoter Score (NPS) for LP base
4. Analyze by investor type, commitment size, tenure
5. Identify at-risk relationships: declining scores, reduced engagement, missed meetings
6. Create action plan for bottom-quartile satisfaction areas
7. Benchmark against industry (ILPA survey data, peer GP feedback)

## Red Flags & Failure Modes

1. **Stale valuations**: Using appraisals older than 90 days for investor reporting. Appraisal lag distorts returns by 1-2 quarters in volatile markets.
2. **Benchmark mismatch**: Comparing leveraged fund returns to NPI (unleveraged). Always adjust for leverage or use ODCE for levered open-end comparison.
3. **IRR manipulation**: Subscription credit facilities inflate early-period IRR by delaying capital calls. Disclose with and without facility impact.
4. **GIPS violations**: Excluding underperforming portfolios from composites, changing composite definitions retroactively, or presenting gross-only returns without net.
5. **Audit timeline slip**: Missing the 90-day deadline triggers LP reporting covenant breaches and potential key-person event concerns.
6. **Re-up fatigue**: Approaching LPs too early (before DPI > 0.5x) or too late (after competing GPs have locked commitments). Sweet spot: DPI 0.3-0.5x with strong unrealized pipeline.
7. **Capital call overdraw**: Calling more than LP commitment balance. Always reconcile unfunded commitment ledger before issuing calls.
8. **Side letter creep**: Granting preferential terms without tracking MFN implications. Every side letter term must be logged and MFN-eligible LPs notified.

## Chain Notes

- Feeds into: `deal-underwriting-engine` (new fund deployment), `asset-valuation-model` (quarterly NAV for reporting)
- Receives from: `portfolio-risk-monitor` (risk metrics for investor decks), `property-operations-admin-toolkit` (NOI actuals for performance attribution)
- Coordinate with: `crisis-special-situations-playbook` when investor communication requires crisis messaging
- Data dependencies: custodian/administrator capital account statements, third-party appraisals, benchmark data subscriptions (NCREIF membership required)
- Frequency: Quarterly (meetings, reporting), Annual (audit, GIPS, satisfaction survey), Ad hoc (re-up, capital calls/distributions)
